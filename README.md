A developer portfolio with a retro Japanese ramen shop aesthetic, combining terminal-style interfaces with immersive interactive elements.

## üöÄ Current Features

- **Terminal-Style Interface**: Interactive command-line experience with typing animations
- **Ramen-Inspired Design**: Visual elements including a 2D animated ramen bowl with steam effects
- **Project Showcase**: Detailed project information displayed in terminal windows
- **Technical Skills Section**: Comprehensive overview of technologies and development experience
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes
- **Animated Elements**: Smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion

## üåü Future Expansion Plans

### 3D Interactive Elements
The next major update will introduce immersive 3D elements using Three.js, elevating the visual experience:

- **3D Ramen Bowl Model**: Replace the current 2D representation with a fully interactive 3D model
- **Particle System Steam**: Advanced particle effects for more realistic steam
- **Interactive Elements**: Allow users to interact with objects in the 3D space

## üíª Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite
- **Styling**: Styled Components
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **Icons**: React Icons
- **Typography**: IBM Plex Mono, Noto Sans JP

## üß† AI Integration Process

Our approach to integrating AI-generated assets involves:

1. **Concept Generation**: Using AI to brainstorm and visualize potential 3D elements
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting detailed prompts for generative AI tools to create base models
3. **Blender Integration**: Importing AI-generated base models into Blender for refinement
4. **Optimization**: Reducing polygon counts and optimizing textures for web performance
5. **Rigging & Animation**: Setting up animation systems for interactive elements
6. **Three.js Implementation**: Integrating the optimized models into the Three.js environment
7. **Interactive Programming**: Adding user interaction capabilities to 3D elements
